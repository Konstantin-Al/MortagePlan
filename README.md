I have created two users: "bank" and "user1"
These users have the same password (23),  but different permissions.

There are two user roles:
admin
user (regular user)

The user "bank" has administrator privileges, but "user1" doesn't have Admin rights.


Admin has rights to:
Create a new user
access to all records
Manage the list of users
Import file for calculations

User has rights to:
Access to own personal records
make a new calculation
